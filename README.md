# Odin Rock, Paper, Scissor

This project is about implementing Rock, Paper, Scissor using JavaScript.

## How It's Made
For this project, I first begin with creating a placeholder html page. Afterward, I create an external JavaScript file that will contain the code to do rock, paper, scissor. User input can only be changed in the JavaScript file for the time being, while the computer will randomly choose from three options in the array choices ["rock", "paper", "scissor"]. Everything is logged in the console input, and there are no outputs to the HTML page of the results.

## Lessons Learned
This project is putting into practice of the foundations taught in The Odin Project, as well as how to problem solve before working on the problem. I find that planning in advance before doing any coding is helpful as it helps me compartmentalize the big problems into smaller problems for me to do. An example would be hardcoding the valid choices "rock, paper, scissor" into an array, and from this, only three conditional statements are needed to decide how the match plays out. Not only does this save space for game algorithm, but it also enable the usage of template literals for the string text.
